To Run the app you will need node and npm
How to check if node and npm are already installed on your device:
Run
```
npm -v
```
and
```
node -v
```
in terminal. If it doesn't give you the version (ex. 6.14.9) then you need install it from https://nodejs.org/en/download/. Just click on the installer with the OS logo on it.

Check again in terminal if you have node installed.
Then in terminal go inside the tailgate folder and run npm install. It should install all of the packages.

How to start the website:
Run
```
npm start
```

If this doesn't work just text Yazan because I'm not sure if you need to do other stuff I haven't set it up in a while.
